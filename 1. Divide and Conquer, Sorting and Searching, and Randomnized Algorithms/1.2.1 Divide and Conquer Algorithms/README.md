#1.2.1 Divide and Conquer Algorithms  
## The divide and conquer paradigm:  
	1. divide into smaller sub-problems  
	2. conquer via recursion  
	3. combine solutions (usually the step that takes most thinking time)  



## The problem - example

Inversion paris,  motivation is to determine how similar two arrays are  
Key idea: divide and concquer
