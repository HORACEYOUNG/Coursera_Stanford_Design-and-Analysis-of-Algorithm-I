# Coursera Stanford Design and Analysis of Algorithm I
# Intruduction
  The purpose of this repository is to hold the notes that I generated during the process of learning the course, the solutions to the assignments after each subunit, and the python inplementation source code of the mentioned algorithms. I hope this repository can help ones who also followed the same Coursera course find some insights and provoke communication.
## Arrangements
