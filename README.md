The purpose of this repository is to hold the notes that I generated during the process of learning the course, the solutions to the assignments
 after each subunit, and the python inplementation source code of the mentioned algorithms. I hope this repository can help ones who also fo
 llowed the same Coursera course find some insights and provoke communication.
